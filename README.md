# morse-code-translator

This task will require me to create a web page Morse Code translator. The User Interface will have to look good but should remain simple (additional features, ie. sounds, lights, etc, should only be added once the MVP has been completed.)

## Demo & Snippets

- Include hosted link - WIP
- Include images of app if CLI or Client App - WIP

---

## Requirements / Purpose

- MVP

- Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code
- Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

  - translate their English text into Morse Code
  - Morse Code into English text
  - Make sure to add tests for all your translate logic, you want to have some pure functions that take an - input and return that input translated
  - Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)

  - purpose of project

  The pupose of the project is to showcase what I have learnt about JavaScript, JavaScript DOM manipulation along with HTML, CSS. I also need to show how to do testing for my own code.

  - stack used and why

  HTML - for basic structures
  CSS - to make it look good
  JavaScript - to add functionality that means when users give any input to translate in morse code, it should translate the input into morse code or vice versa.
