# morse-code-translator

This task requires me to create a web page Morse Code translator. The User Interface will have to look good but should remain simple (additional features, ie. sounds, lights, etc, should only be added once the MVP has been completed.)

## Demo & Snippets

- Include hosted link -
- Include images of app if CLI or Client App
 
---

## Requirements / Purpose

- MVP

- Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code
- Create JS functions that would allow the user to:

  - translate their English text into Morse Code
  - Morse Code into English text
  - Make sure to add tests for all your translate logic, you want to have some pure functions that take an - input and return that input translated
  - Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)

  - purpose of project

  The pupose of the project is to showcase what I have learnt about JavaScript, JavaScript DOM manipulation along with HTML, CSS. I also need to show how to do testing for my own code.

  - stack used and why

  HTML - for basic structures
  CSS - to make it look good
  JavaScript - JavaScript is used to add the functionality that means when users give any input to translate in morse code, it should translate the input into morse code or vice versa.

## Build Steps

- how to build / run project
- use proper code snippets if there are any commands to run

---

## Design Goals / Approach

- Design goals
- why did you implement this the way you did?

---

## Features

- What features does the project have?
- list them...

---

## Known issues

- Remaining bugs, things that have been left unfixed
- Features that are buggy / flimsy

---

## Future Goals

- What are the immediate features you'd add given more time

---

## What did you struggle with?

- making JavaScript functionality work, was challenging. Even though the I have written the functions, imports were not working properly due to invalid variable inputs.

- Also, writing a test for my code and pass the testing were challenging.

- I have only build English to Morse code and Morse code to English translator. In coming days, I plan to include other languages and also aiming to build a picture to morse code and morse code to picture translator.
